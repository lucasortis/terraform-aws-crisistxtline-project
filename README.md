# Crisis Text Line - Terraform Infrastructure

*This README was created using Claude Sonnet 4 through GitHub Copilot and fully revised by me.*

This repository contains the Terraform infrastructure code for the Crisis Text Line project, designed with multi-environment support and modular architecture.

## Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository**
2. **Configure your AWS credentials** (AWS CLI profile)
3. **Create/configure S3 backend (if needed)** (see [Backend Setup](#backend-setup))
4. **Run Terraform commands** using the helper script

```bash
# Plan for dev environment
./terraform-helper.sh --env=dev plan

# Apply for dev environment  
./terraform-helper.sh --env=dev apply

# Destroy resources
./terraform-helper.sh --env=dev destroy
```

## Architecture

The infrastructure is organized into reusable modules:

- **VPC Module** (`modules/vpc/`) - Complete VPC setup with public/private subnets
- **Security Group Module** (`modules/security-group/`) - Network security and access control
- **ALB Module** (`modules/alb/`) - Application Load Balancer for traffic distribution
- **ECS Module** (`modules/ecs/`) - Containerized application hosting with Fargate
- **IAM Module** (`modules/iam/`) - Secure access management and roles
- **CloudWatch Module** (`modules/cloudwatch/`) - Monitoring, logging, and alerting

## Environment Management

### Current Environments

The project supports multiple environments with isolated state and configurations:

- **dev** - Development environment
- **prd** - Production environment

### Environment Structure

Each environment has its own directory under `environments/`:

```
environments/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dev/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars      # Environment-specific variables
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.s3.tfbackend # S3 backend configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ prd/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.tfvars
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ terraform.s3.tfbackend
```

### Adding New Environments

To add a new environment (e.g., `stg`, `uat`, `qa`):

1. **Update variable validation** in `variables.tf`:
   ```hcl
   variable "environment" {
     description = "The environment for which the resources are being created."
     type        = string
     validation {
       condition     = contains(["dev", "stg", "uat", "qa", "prd"], var.environment)
       error_message = "The environment must be one of: dev, stg, uat, qa, prd."
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Create environment directory**:
   ```bash
   mkdir environments/stg
   ```

3. **Create `terraform.tfvars`**:
   ```hcl
   region      = "us-east-1"
   profile     = "personal"
   environment = "stg"
   
   tags = {
     "Environment" = "stg"
     "Project"     = "Crisis Text Line"
     "CostCenter"  = "Engineering Team"
   }
   
   project_name = "CrisisTextLine"
   create_vpc   = true
   cidr_block   = "10.43.0.0/16"  # Use different CIDR per environment
   ```

4. **Create `terraform.s3.tfbackend`**:
   ```hcl
   bucket       = "your-bucket-name-stg"
   key          = "crisistextline-project/terraform.tfstate"
   region       = "us-east-1"
   profile      = "personal"
   use_lockfile = true
   ```

## Terraform Helper Script

The `terraform-helper.sh` script simplifies Terraform operations across environments.

### Usage

```bash
./terraform-helper.sh [-e=ENVIRONMENT|--env=ENVIRONMENT] [COMMAND]
```

### Parameters

- **Environment Flag**: `-e=ENV` or `--env=ENV`
  - Default: `dev`
  - Available: `dev`, `prd` (or custom environments you create)

- **Commands**:
  - `plan` - Creates execution plan and saves to `tfplan`
  - `apply` - Applies the saved plan from `tfplan`
  - `destroy` - Destroys all managed infrastructure

### Examples

```bash
# Development environment
./terraform-helper.sh -e=dev plan
./terraform-helper.sh -e=dev apply

# Production environment
./terraform-helper.sh --env=prd plan
./terraform-helper.sh --env=prd apply

# Default environment (dev)
./terraform-helper.sh plan
./terraform-helper.sh apply

# Cleanup
./terraform-helper.sh -e=dev destroy
```

### How It Works

The script:
1. Cleans up any existing `.terraform` directory
2. Validates the specified environment exists
3. Runs `terraform init` with the environment-specific backend configuration
4. Executes the requested Terraform command with environment-specific variables

## Backend Setup

This project uses S3 for remote state storage. Each environment has its own S3 bucket for isolation.

### Creating S3 Backend Buckets

To create S3 buckets for Terraform state storage, use the dedicated repository:

**Repository**: https://github.com/lucasortis/terraform-aws-s3-tfstate

1. Clone the S3 backend repository
2. Follow the setup instructions in its README
3. Create buckets for each environment
4. Update the `terraform.s3.tfbackend` files with your bucket names

### Backend Configuration

Each environment's `terraform.s3.tfbackend` file should contain:

```hcl
bucket       = "your-unique-bucket-name-{env}"
key          = "crisistextline-project/terraform.tfstate"
region       = "us-east-1"
profile      = "personal"
use_lockfile = true
```
